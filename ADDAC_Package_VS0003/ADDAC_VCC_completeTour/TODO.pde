there's an inversion between straight gate in to out!
ADSR release after gate off!! and correct the trigger because right now what happens is that once gate is on it's always retriggering the adsr, and once it's off it runs it...
   make it in a way that once is on it triggers the adsr and holds in sustain until gate is off and then goes to decay!!

MAKE A THRU MIDI OUTPUT in the midi panel
